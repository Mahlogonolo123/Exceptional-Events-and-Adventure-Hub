   <p>The city of Mahikeng offers interesting historical and cultural attractions, and excellent shopping malls close to the reserve.</p>
   <h5>Botsalano Game Reserve</h5>
   <h6>A Major Wildlife Breeding Centre</h6>
   <p>Situated 18km south of the Ramatlabama Border Post into Botswana, to the west of Mahikeng, the 5 800ha. Botsalano Game Reserve is also home to one of the oldest volcanic craters in the world, which extends through the reserve to Botswana. The reserve is primarily a game breeding game reserve. Its white rhino and antelope, in particular, are used to stock other North West game reserves. At Botsalano, wildlife is easily seen from a plethora of birds to tall giraffes and trundling tortoises. An excellent choice for mature lovers looking for some peace, quite and an affordable bush break. Botsalano Game Reserve is compact with a large network of roads from which to view the park's numerous antelope species and other games</p>

   <h5>Molemane Eye Nature Reserve</h5>
   <h6>Natural spring water at Molemane Eye Nature Reserve</h6>
   <p>Molemane Eye Nature Reserve was established in 1992: when Elizabeth Duncan Rose (Né Gubbins) bequeathed her farm, Malmani Oog to the North West Parks and Tourism Board on the condition that it be declared a nature reserve and should never be sold</p>
   <p>Elizabeth had inherited the farm from her father Dr. John Gubbins, a distinguished collector of Africana, who had made his maney mining fluorspar. The farmland around Molemane Eye was owned by the state around the 1800's and it was decided to erect a mill around the river to service the farmers of the district. Before occupation of the land by the Boers, the district was inhabitated by Mzilikazi and the Matabele between 1825 and 1837. Dr John Gubbins (from Upham, Hampshire in England) bought the farm in 1908 and improved the mill house with imported new machinery from England</p>
   <p>Molemane Eye has a rich cultural history with many old mining sites, but the reserve is best known for its natural well after which it is named. The eye on its own can generate over two million litres of crystal clear water per day that feeds the Molemane and Marico Rivers. Half of the well's water drives a water wheel, which in turn drives an old mill. The mill is a national monument and still in working order. The rest of the water coming from the well feeds the dam in the nature reserve</p>
   <p>There is an old mining site situated south of the water mill, where it was erroneously presumed that this was a diamond mine-although it is true that diamond prospecting was done on the site in the 1940's with little or no success. The grain silo is a unique structure which formed part of the out-buildings - it is still retained as important structure and part of the history of Molemane Eye</p>
   <h6>Activities at Molemane Eye</h6>
   <p>The main house at Molemane was started in 1908, built gradually over time and completed in about 1922. Many of the outbuilding such as the creamery, milking sheds and stores were also constructed at about the same time. The design of the house is neo-colonial with open verandas and stairs sweeping out into the garden and is now being sued as the reserve administration offices</p>
   <p>Fishing is permitted on the reserve on a strictly catch and release basis. Molemane Eye is an attractive destination for nature lovers, who want a rustic, off the beaten track gateway from city life. Tge reserve is situated 45km from the town of Lichtenburg on the Lichtenburg Zeerust road (R505)</p>
   <h3>Ramotshere Moiloa Local Municipality</h3>
   <h4>Attractions</h4>
   <h4>Madikwe Game Reserve</h4>
   <h5>Cultural history of Madikwe Reserve</h5>
   <p>Madikwe's rich cultural historical and geological formations are almost one million years old and is as the much a part of the Reserve as the wildlife and other natural wonders in the area. Historical sites containing irreplaceable artifacts are in abundance and in time will be restored and displayed as part of South Africa's heritage</p>
   <h6>Stone Age</h6>
   <p>In 1996 archaeologists unearthed many artifacts in the Reserve dating back from the early Stone Age to the late Stone Age (between 10 000 and 500 years ago). These artifacts consisting of various stone tools, confirm that Stone Age man lived and hunted in Madikwe. Many of these artifacts were found close to outcrops of the stone used to create the tools, along the Marico River, close to Tweedepoort Ridge</p>
   <h6>Iron Age</h6>
   <p>The Middle Iron Age people started to arrive in the Dwarsberg/Marico River region after 900 AD. The oldest Iron Age pottery found in the Madikwe Reserve is from Eiland phase of Kalundu dating back to between 900 AD and 1300 AD</p>
   <p>*One such site is in the Dwarsberge on the eastern side of the Reserve</p>
   <p>*A Second site is in the Tweedepoort Ridge a few kilometers east.of the Wonderboom Gate.</p>
   <p>Their huts were cylindrical with mud-plastered walls and thatched conical roofs. Cattle enclosures and fences around the settlement are made from thom tree branches. Sorghum, millet and other crops were grown on the settlement's perimeter on good soil that could be cultivated with a hoe. Building of the thousands of interlinked circular stone walled structures, which can be seen today, began in about 1600 AD</p>
   <h6>Sotho-Tswana People</h6>
   <p>From about 1300 AD to 1420 AD the climate was colder and dryer than today because of the effects of the Little Ice Age. During this time Sotho-Tswana people started moving south from East Africa </p>
   <p>Sotho-Tswana pottery, called Moloko dating between the 15th and 17th centuries has been found on red soil patches at the base of the Tweedepoort Ridge and along the eastern half of the Dwarsberge, all within the Reserve. In Madikwe, the red soil was preferred to the black clay as it could support sorghum and millet agriculture and provide a stable foundation for huts</p>
   <p>*One well-preserved site, next to the Phofu Dam, consisted of cattle byre, sorghum grindstones and several exposed hut floors with portions of molded benches a characteristic of early Moloko huts</p>
   <p>Among the first Sotho-Tswana groups to arrive in the area were the Hurutshe people who settled along the Marico River. Their main settlement, Kaditshwene, South of Madikwe eventually became one of the largest towns in Southern Africa. In 1800 AD, its population was estimated to be around the same as Cape Town's population at the time. After some time the Hurutshe sub-divided and the offshoots moved east towards the Magaliesberg</p>
   <h6>The Difaqane</h6>
   <p>The Difatane was a period of serious unrest in South Africa, which, in Madikwe, forced Sotho-Tswana people to move their homesteads to the tops of the hills and live in large settlements for defensive reasons</p>
   <p>This was the time of Difaqane when Mzilikazi and his impis of warriors terrorized the region, which after several years of turmoil, virtual destroyed the Sotho-Tswana culture in the Magaliesberg and Dwarsberg areas. Thr Kwena settlement near Olifantsnek and the Hurutshe tone of Kaditshwene in the Marico River Valley lay in ruins</p>
   <p>The name Marico comes from the Tswana word "Malicoe" which means "drenched with blood" which refers to the battle that destroyed Kaditshwene in 1823</p>
   <p>*Remnants of the stonewalled settlements built on the hilltops can still be found on and around the Inselbergs in the northwest corner of Madikwe Game Reserve. These defensive sites date back to between 1800 and 1840</p>
   <h6>The Boers</h6>
   <p>Boers settled and farmed in the Marico River Valley, which they had freed from Mzilikazi's rule and consequently the Sotho-Tswana people, who had been enslaved by Mzilikazi, resettled in the area. Some Boers took to hunting for meat , skins and ivory, and when the elephants wwre shot out in the Marico area, moved north to Botswana and Matabeleland. A hunter's road was established through the Madikwe Game Reserve to Derdepoort, and the two wells at the top of the pass through the Tweedepoort Ridge were probably part of a resting place for the hunter's wagon trains The famous hunter, Frederick Courtney Selous, passed through Madikwe several times between 1875 and 1884 en route to Matabeleland.</p>
   <p>In 1854 Andries Pretorius, after negotiations with British, finally gained independence for the Zuid-Afrikaanse Republiek, comprising the area north of Vaal River including the Madikwe/Dwarsberg Area. In 1877 the British annexed the area, which was called the Tranvaal. The annexation was rejected by the Boers and Resulted in the Tranvaal War from 1880 to 1881.The Boers hung on to the Transvaal, but in 1899 the South Africa War began, ending in 1902 after many battles with the British taking control of the entire country </p>
   <p>*In the northeast corner of Madikwe, fortifications date back to this period where the battle took place between the Boers and the combined forces of the British and Bakgatla</p>
   <h6>The formation of the Madikwe Game Reserve</h6>
   <p>At one stage the Marico area in North West Province was listed as one of the poorest areas in South Africa, but after being declared a national park in 1991 has undergone a massive transformation to economically uplift the communities living in this otherwise rather destitute area</p>
   <p>The 750 km Madikwe Game Reserve is located 90km north of the small town of Zeerust on the border with Botswana and named after the Madikwe or Marico Rive, on whose basin it is formed.The vast area was primarily used for farming beforehand but due to the poor soil, farming was not successful. After extensive research, the South Africa Government found that this land would be best utilized as a national park. A special feature of Madikwe lies in its unique location, a traditional zone on the edges of the Kalahari, where a number of rare animal species occur naturally and the bushveld</p>
   <p>It is currently the fifth largest game reserve in South Africa and yet not widely known. The 63 000ha park consists mainly of open grasslands and bushveld plains, interspersed with rocky outcrops and bordered to the south by the Dwarsberg Mountain.Madikwe has been hailed as one of the success stories regarding nature conservation, together with members of the local community in Southern Africa.</p>
   <p>Before Madikwe became an official game reserve, work had already begun to remove many of the derelict farm buildings, non-indigenous plants and the hundreds of kilometers of old fencing. Many of these old buildings were spared and turned into workshops and park offices. Some of the outposts were also left and are being used to accomodate reserve staff and game scouts</p>
   <p>The game reserve has recently opened itself up to private farms outside the main reserve. Private land users need to abide by the North West Park Board (NWPB) rules - animals can roam over any land, but there are restrictions to where private vehicles can drive. The are 29 lodges in Madikwe and sic lodges on the private farms outside the main reserve. NWPB has introduced Community Lodges, which the local villages own and run, with all the profits used for the benefit of the community</p>
   <h6>Operation Phoenix</h6>
   <p>Madikwe Game Reserve features the Big 5 - lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, both white and black rhinos along with most of the plains antelope species. The huge process of reintroducing wildlife to Madikwe began in 1992 and was codenamed Operation Phoenix, which relocated entire breeding herds of elephants, buffaloes, white and black rhinos along with various species of antelope. Over a period of seven years Madikwe also successfully reintroduced predatory species such as lions, cheetahs, spotted hyenas and wild dogs to bring the total large mammal population of the reserve to over 10 000 animals. There are currently more than 63 species of mammal in the park</p>
   <p>Over 300 bird species have been recorded at Madikwe. The reserve has an excellent record of environmental management which has ensured that the carrying capacity of the reserve is never exceeded to the detriment of the eco-system as a whole. Madikwe is a low density tourism facility offering fully catered accomodation at several luxury lodges within the reserve. The reserve is not open to day visitors</p>
   <h6>Climate and Weather </h6>
   <p>Madikwe forms part of a semi-arid region on the edge of the Kalahari Desert. The climate can be broken into the rainy season (May September}. Summer coincide with the rainy season and temperatures range between 32 - 36 °C with cooling thundershowers common in the late afternoon</p>
   <p>Evenings are mild at around 16 - 18 °C. Winters are dry, with mild days (18 - 210°C) and chilly nights (3 - 5 °C). Game viewing is good at all times of the year, through most animals tend to congregate around available water sources during the winter</p>

   <h5>The Origins Of Pilanesberg National Park</h5>
   <h6>Geological Formation</h6>
   <p>
     It all started 2 000 million years ago when the area of Pilanesberg was an active volcano, towering 7 000 metres in height, rivalling even Africa's highest peak, Mount Kilimanjaro in grandeur. Described by geologist as the Pilanesberg is very old and was one of only three alkaline volcanoes on earth. Over time, a series of eruptions occurred and there were further outpouring of lava, craters collapsed, ring fracturing took place around the volcano and magma was squeezed into these fractures.
   </p>
   <p>
     The end result is several concentric "onions rings" of rocks of different ages. Erosion over many millions of years has stripped away the mountain and the highest peak, Matlhorwe, now rises 700 metres above the valleys. What we see today is not so much a volcanic crater, but a cross-section through magma pipes that were located at a great depth below the mountain's summit.
   </p>
   <h6>Middle Stone Age And Iron Age Tswana Settlement</h6>
   <p>Human beings have been in the Pilanesberg area since the Middle Stone Age and many artefact from this period can be found throughout the park. Hunter-gatherers also roamed the area well before the first Setswana-speaking people settled as cattle and grain farmers.</p>
   <p>During the latter Iron Age period, the ancestors of the Batswana and Basotho occupied the area, they were cattle farmers and pastoralists who also worked copper and iron. Major Tswana towns were established in the late 18th century with entire chiefdoms of 10 000 people or more living together in these settlements. Some historians believe that these towns were developed as a reaction to the troubles times of the Difaqane. The Marothodi archaeological site, 10km to the west of Pilanesberg, is a remnant from this era. Marothodi (meaning raindrops) was the capital of the Batlokwa chiefdom. Town life in Marothodi included the  production of copper and iron and was strictly governed along Batswana cultural systems and values. Most of these towns were destroyed in the Difaqane wars that raged in the Pilanesberg/Magaliesberg region in the late 1820's, when Mzilikazi and his Ndebele impis occupied the area</p>
   <p>The Batlhako and Bakgatla Ba ga Kgafela (clans account of the Setswana linguistic group) occupied the Pilanesberg region in the latter part of the 18th century. Many of thir cattle kraals and outpost have been identified as part of their cattle kraals and outposts have been identified as part of the more than 60 archaeological sites recorded in the Pilanesberg to date. It is clear that the strategic advantage of high ground abundant wildlife, shelter,water and the fertile valleys of the Pilanesberg was highly valued through the ages.</p>
   <h6>Trouble Times During The Difaqane Wars</h6>
   <p>During the late 1820's Spaung Mzilikazi invaded the Magaliesberg area and the region to the west of Pilanesberg, Although most of the skirmishes were to the south and west of Pilanesberg, it had a profound effect on the entire area. Everyday life of the Batswana people and some of the Nguni people, who started settling in the area before the Ndebele invasion, was greatly disrupted as Mzilikazi and his impis massacre the occupants of the land. During this time, the Bakgatla fled into the hills of Pilanesberg in an attempt to escape this mass onslaught, eventually surrendering as the Pilanesberg was surrounded by the Ndebele. Mzilikazi then controlled all of the land and settled with his warriors to the west of Pilanesberg</p>
   <p>Early attempts by European missionaries to meet with the Ndebele king in 1829 proved to be fruitless. However, Robert Moffat, the world-renowned missionary then based at Kuruman, was brought to the Magaliesberg on request of Mzilikazi, who seemed to be impressed with what had been done in Kuruman. Maffat trekked via the southern foothills of Pilanesberg in 1829, where he observed the distraction caused during the Difaqane wars</p>
   <p>
     During this visit, an unlikely and long lasting friendship developed between Moffat and Mzilikazi and as a result all travellers to the new Ndebele kingdom had to come via Kuruman with the blessing of Moffat. The Bakgatla has a long history of missionary interaction culminating with the development of the George Stegman Hospital.
   </p>
   <p>
     The expeditions of Dr Andrew Smith and Captain Sir Williams Cornwallis-Harris (1836) gives the first well-documented records of the people and wildlife of the Pilanesberg. Dr Smith witnessed the ruins of the former inhabitants of the area during his visit in 1835.
   </p>
  <p>
    His expedition comprising of an entourage of 40 people accompanied by Moffat, who used the opportunity to again meet with Mzilikazi with the request of opening a mission station in the area.
  </p>
  <p>
    Smith recorded the abundant wildlife in his journal and later became the founder of the South African Museum in Cape Town
  </p>
  <h6>Arrival Of Europeans And Voortrekkers</h6>
  <p>The first Boer settlers arrived in the Magaliesberg area from the Caoe Colony in 1936 after becoming disgruntled by British rule, where they were held at bay by Mzilikazi, who did not hesitate to attack anyone crossing the Vaal River</p>
  <p>
    After the successful Voortrekker battle against a large Ndebele army at Mosega in 1836, the Zulu also fought a major battle against Mzilikazi in 1837 directly west of Pilanesberg, where, the Ndebele yoke was substantially broken. This encouraged further attacks against the Ndebele by the Voortrekkers, Griqua and Tswana and the Ndebele fled across the Limpopo River to the north, where they found the present city of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe 
  </p>
  <p>During the 1840's many Voortrekker continued to settle the land with many former Tswana inhabitants returning to the land. Many of the Tswana were disgruntled with the Voortrekkers occupying their ancestral land and moved elsewhere</p>
  <p>
    However, many remained and worked on the Boer farms as labourers and fought alongside the Boers to fend off attempts by Mzilikazi to reclaim the land. By 1849, all of the land had been allocated and Tswana groups wanting to return, could only resettle if they were prepared to buy back their ancestral land from the Boers. By the 1850's the Magaliesberg to the south was well -eatablished as a farming area. Pilanesberg was mainly a cattle farming area and the fertile valleys were planted with citrus trees and annual crops
    </p>
    <h6>The Concept Of A Protected Area></h6>
    <p>
      The white farmers of the Pilanesberg were expropriated by the Nationalist government during the early 1960's as part of a plan to make more land available for settlement of Batswana people in a so-called 'homeland'. Pilanesberg thus became part of the former homeland of Bophuthatswana, Which was established in 1977.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, not all farms were occupied by white farmers and certain properties within the boundaries of what is today called Pilanesberg were still owned and occupied by the Bakgatla people.
    </p>
    <p>
      As early as 1969, the potential of the Pilanesberg as a conservation area was identified. Formal recommendations were made to the Bakgatla leadership of the Bophuthatswana government in 1977 for the area to be used for tourism and conservation and it was agreed that the Bakgatla inhabitants of the Pilanesberg crater vacate the land. Pilanesberg was established in 1979 and declared a national park in 19
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilanesberg's philosophy from the outset was to conserve biodiversity, but at the same time maximize the park's economic contribution derived from eco-tourism to the regional economy. It became the first protected area in Africa to be developed not only for conservation purposes, but also with the specific intent of generating socio-economic benefits. North West Parks Board, as the custodians of Pilanesberg, continues to believe that if conservation is to succeed in Africa, then local communities must benefit significantly from wildlife conservation and related activities 
    </p>
    <h6>Operation Genesis And Development Of The Park</h6>
    <p>
      As most of the land in the Pilanesberg was used for farming, the rehabilitation plan for the area included the removal of old cattle kraals, fences, drinking troughs and the sealing and marking of boreholes
    </p>
    <p>
      The demolition of homesteads, removal of windmills, the breaching of certain earth dams and eradication of citrus orchards and alien trees and plantations of gum trees, and the removal of all other signs of human habitation and farming activities was a major task in establishing the conservation area 
    </p>
    <p>
      Construction of the game fence began in 1979 and the rough topography required ingenious skills to contain dangerous animals. By 1985 all telephone lines had been removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gravel roads, dams and game viewing hides were constructed and construction of the Manyane complex, which is one of the best planned and most popular rest camps in South Africa, also commerced in 1985
    </p>
    <p>
      The police station and staff houses were demolished at the Pilanesberg magistrate's quarters. The old courthouse, built in 1936, was conveted into the popular day visitor restaurant, curio shop and game viewing deck that is known as the Pilanesberg Centre today.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the tourism numbers grew, private concessionaires were constructed to develop game lodges. The Pilanesberg was hus transformed in a decade from being a scenic volcanic crater inhabited by cattle and the odd baboon troops to one of the leading wildlife destination in South Africa 
    </p>
    <p>
      Operation Genesis saw the release of over 6 000 animals, representing 22 species into the park during the early 1980's. Predators such as lion, cheetah and wild dog were later released to restore the ecological balance, while leopard, brown hyena, black-backed jackal and caracal occurred naturally 
    </p>
    <p>
      The game introduction process was a resounding success and today the Pilanesberg contains the abundance of game that was recorded by the famous hunter-explorer, William Cornwallis-Harris in 1836
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pilanesberg National Park is a wildlife conservation area and the main activity within the park are game viewing and drives to explore the interesting Flora and fauna of the area. To ensure your stay in the Pilanesberg National Park is both safe and enjoyable, please adhere to the following simple rules, as you are sharing the Park with other visitors, as well as many interesting and amazing animals

    </p>
    <p>•Treat all wildlife with caution and respect </p>
    <p>
      The animals in the Park are wild so treat them as such. Keep your distance from potentially dangerous animals, such as elephant, rhino and lions.
